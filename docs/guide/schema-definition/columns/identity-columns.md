# Identity Columns

An identity column is a special column that is generated automatically from an implicit sequence. It can be used to generate key values.

It's PostgreSQL native implementation of [`serial`](data-types.md#serial) and [`bigserial`](data-types.md#bigserial) data types in other SQL implementations.

The following column data types can be used as identity columns:
- [smallint](./data-types.md#smallint)
- [integer](./data-types.md#integer)
- [bigint](./data-types.md#bigint)

There are two types identity columns: `GENERATED ALWAYS AS` and `GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS`.
They mainly differ in whether the database will allow you to override the generated value when inserting data.

`GENERATED ALWAYS AS` columns are values always generated by the database, and you cannot override the generated value when inserting a new row (expect when using the `OVERRIDING SYSTEM VALUE` clause).

`GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS` columns values are generated by the database it be overridden by an explicit value value.

## Generated always as identity column

```ts
import { table, text } from "monolayer/pg";

const users = table({
  columns: {
    id: integer().generatedAlwaysAsIdentity(), //  [!code highlight]
  },
});
```

## Generated by default as identity column

```ts
const accounts = table({
  columns: {
    id: integer().generatedByDefaultAsIdentity(), //  [!code highlight]
  },
});
```
