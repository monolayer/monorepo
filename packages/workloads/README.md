# Workloads

Workloads is a companion framework that works alongside your full-stack React framework (such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Remix](https://remix.run)).

## Features

#### Stateful and stateless workloads

Define and run locally a diverse set of workloads for your web application.

- Stateful: Databases, key value stores, object storage, etc.
- Stateless: Scheduled tasks, batch jobs, real-time browser-server communication.

#### Freedom to Use Your Favorite Tools

We respect your library and package preferences to write web applications.

Continue using them, rather than beign forced into new ones.

#### A Dev Environment That Just Works

Spin up dev and test environments for your workloads with zero-config.

Spend less time configuring and more time coding.

#### Framework defined infrastructure

When you're ready to deploy, `Workloads` provides you with building blocks for automatic infrastructure provisioning.
