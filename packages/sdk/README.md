# Workloads

Build and deploy full-stack applications with zero infrastructure overhead.
Use the sdk alongside your full-stack React framework, such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

## Features

#### Stateful and stateless workloads

Define and run locally a diverse set of workloads for your web application.

- Stateful: Databases, key value stores, object storage, etc.
- Stateless: Scheduled tasks, cron jobs, real-time server-browser communication.

#### A Dev Environment That Just Works

Spin up dev and test environments for your workloads with zero-config.

Spend less time configuring and more time coding.
